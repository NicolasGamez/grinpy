# GrinPy
*A NetworkX extension for calculating graph invariants.*

### What is it?
GrinPy is still in development. We are working hard to finish the first build. Our aim is to create an easy-to-use extension of NetworkX for computing all kinds of graph invariants.

### How do I use it?
Full documentation will be released soon. For now, here's a sample:
```python
>>> import grinpy as gp
>>> G = gp.petersen_graph()
>>> gp.independence_number(G)
4
```

GrinPy automatically imports NetworkX and provides all of the NetworkX classes and methods in the same interface.

### Why does it exist?
The motivation for this project is to filter a database of graphs into an ordered tree of subsets. The graphs in this database are relatively small (no more than 16 - 20 vertices) and thus, in the interest of quickly creating our database, we have written brute force algorithms for finding many of the NP-hard invariants. After the first build we will work on improving our algorithms.
